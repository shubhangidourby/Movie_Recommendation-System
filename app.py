intro = '''With the growth of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, and other similar web services over the last few decades, recommender systems have become increasingly important in our lives. Recommender systems are becoming ubiquitous in our daily online trips, from e-commerce (suggest articles to buyers that may be of interest) to online advertising (suggest the suitable contents to users based on their preferences).
Recommender systems, in a broad sense, are algorithms that try to propose relevant items to consumers (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).
In some industries, recommender systems are critical because they can generate a significant amount of revenue or serve as a way to differentiate yourself from competitors.'''

Here we use the similarity scores.It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.')

    'Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.'
